### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    I particularly enjoyed programming the hilo game, because it’s a common guessing game that people play on a regular basis. I also think this is one of the first times we used if statements and for loops so I remember it being something I was afraid of completing. The sandwich program was also really fun to complete, making your own sandwich order and it printing out was a fun experience. 


* Lab 7 

    I liked the Julian's day program because the Julian's day formula wasn’t something I was familiar with, so working with it made my learning experience interesting. It also dealt with functions, which made it a little more difficult. Overall this gave me a push to keep keep working on my programming skills.


* Lab 12

    I really enjoyed this lab because we were able to create a colored image. I also like the difficulty of this lab because it was a challenge, it made me feel accomplished for completing it. The last thing about this lab is that there were some things that I was able to complete just from my knowledge from previous labs.
